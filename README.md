# rubiks_cube

A new Flutter project.

Actually this is my second dart/flutter project with the goal to learn and discover the
features of flutter and the dart language. Most files in this repositry were created by
the `flutter create` command, including this one...
I changed some files, including this REAME.md, but most fun and new files are in the 
`lib/` directory.

Ik wilde weer eens wat programmeren en vond het wel een
uitdaging om een rubik's cube simulator te maken voor Android.

Met flutter en zo.
 
and added a picture...
